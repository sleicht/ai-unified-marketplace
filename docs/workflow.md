# Workflow and artifacts

The AI Unified Process is a requirements-first development workflow adapted from the phases of the
[Rational Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_unified_process). AI Unified Process keeps product intent in
versioned, human-reviewable artifacts that every later step consumes.

## Workflow

```text
Inception          Elaboration                            Construction
─────────────     ───────────────────────────────────     ─────────────────────────────────
/requirements  →  /entity-model  →  /use-case-diagram  →  /use-case-spec  →  migration
                                                                          ↘  implementation
                                                                          ↘  tests
```

`aiup-core` owns the stack-independent steps. A stack plugin owns migrations, implementation, and tests. The boundary
between them is the set of files under `docs/`, not a specific coding agent.

## Artifact flow

| Artifact                  | Produced by         | Consumed by                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| `docs/vision.md`          | Product team        | `/requirements`                    |
| `docs/requirements.md`    | `/requirements`     | Entity model and use case diagram  |
| `docs/entity_model.md`    | `/entity-model`     | Migrations and implementations     |
| `docs/use_cases.puml`     | `/use-case-diagram` | `/use-case-spec` and reviewers     |
| `docs/use_cases/UC-*.md`  | `/use-case-spec`    | Implementations and use case tests |
| `docs/test_cases/TC-*.md` | `/test-case`        | End-to-end journey tests           |

Every artifact is a review point. Correcting an intermediate document is expected and is safer than compensating for
an incorrect assumption in generated code.

## Traceability

AI Unified Process uses stable identifiers to preserve the path from intent to tests:

- Functional requirements use `FR-XXX`; non-functional requirements use `NFR-XXX`; constraints use `C-XXX`.
- Use cases use `UC-XXX` and reference the functional requirements they realize.
- Test cases use `TC-XXX` and reference the use cases in their journey.
- Generated tests retain the applicable `UC-*` or `TC-*` identifier in their name or metadata.

Do not reuse an identifier for a different concern after it has been committed. When a requirement changes, update it
and rerun or reconcile the downstream artifacts that depend on it.

## Coverage check

Traceability is only worth as much as it is checked. `aiup-vaadin-jooq` ships the read-only
[`uc-coverage`](../aiup-vaadin-jooq/agents/uc-coverage.md) sub-agent for that check: it turns a use case specification
into a list of coverage units — every main success scenario step, alternative flow, business rule, precondition, and
postcondition — and maps each one onto the code and the tests that realize it.

It reports gaps (a unit with no code or no test), drift (code or tests the specification no longer describes), and the
specification's justified next `**Status:**` value. It never edits a file; the agent that called it closes the gaps.

That plugin's implementation and testing skills do not run the audit themselves — each run re-reads the
specification and the code base and takes minutes, so the check runs once, explicitly, when you ask for it. The
[`/coverage-check`](../aiup-vaadin-jooq/skills/coverage-check/SKILL.md) skill is that entry point, and the only one
that judges both sides in a single matrix:

```text
/coverage-check UC-001                 # implementation and tests together
/coverage-check UC-001 tests           # narrow the audit to one side
/coverage-check TC-001                 # a journey audits its Flow rows and Validation items
```

A use case whose coverage matrix is complete in both columns is the point at which `**Status:** Tested` is justified.
That is what `/coverage-check UC-001` is for; the skill reports the justified status but leaves the line to you.

The agent's marker table is specific to the Vaadin/jOOQ conventions. The other stack plugins do not ship an equivalent
yet; the same check can be run by hand from
[the agent definition](../aiup-vaadin-jooq/agents/uc-coverage.md) with the markers of the stack in question.

## Core skills

| Skill                                                                | Result                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`/requirements`](../aiup-core/skills/requirements/SKILL.md)         | Requirements catalog derived from `docs/vision.md`              |
| [`/entity-model`](../aiup-core/skills/entity-model/SKILL.md)         | Mermaid entity model and attribute definitions                  |
| [`/use-case-diagram`](../aiup-core/skills/use-case-diagram/SKILL.md) | PlantUML diagram of actors and use cases                        |
| [`/use-case-spec`](../aiup-core/skills/use-case-spec/SKILL.md)       | One detailed specification per use case                         |
| [`/test-case`](../aiup-core/skills/test-case/SKILL.md)               | Executable user journey across specified use cases              |
| [`/reverse-engineer`](../aiup-core/skills/reverse-engineer/SKILL.md) | AI Unified Process baseline recovered from an existing codebase |

The linked `SKILL.md` files are the authoritative descriptions of inputs, outputs, and behavior.

## Working with changes

When product intent changes:

1. Update `docs/vision.md` or the relevant requirement.
2. Reconcile `docs/requirements.md` and keep existing identifiers stable.
3. Revisit the entity model and use case diagram if the domain or user goals changed.
4. Update affected use case and test case documents.
5. Reconcile migrations, implementation, and tests through the selected stack plugin.

Commit `docs/` with the source code. These files explain why the implementation exists and make reviews, onboarding,
and later regeneration reproducible.

## Existing codebases

`/reverse-engineer` inspects entry points, data models, authorization, and integrations to recover the same entity and
use case artifacts produced by the forward workflow. It groups behavior by user goal rather than by endpoint and
reports code it cannot classify. Treat the result as a proposed baseline: resolve gaps and contradictions before
continuing with construction skills.

## Project guidance

Agent instruction files should tell the coding agent to read the AI Unified Process artifacts before making product or architecture
decisions. See [Project setup](guides/project-setup.md) for a generic project tree and reusable templates.
